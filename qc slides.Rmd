- Requires voters to...
  - integrate and appraise performance info  
  - Apply their judgment to vote choice   
- Ex: good economy and incumbent electoral success

# Unexplored microfoundations

### Can subjects differentiate competent from incompetent incumbents?  


- Retrospective voting *requires*
  - **Integration** over stream of performance info
  - **Appraisal** of impression
  
- But I/A largely unseen
  - Uncommon focus of theory
  - Obs & Exp limitations

# Overview of experimental results

- I/A over variable streams
  - Capable judges of competence
  - Clear strategy to confront spillover

- Clear limitations
  - Sub-optimal decisions
  - Recency bias; maybe some negativity bias

- Strategic, if sub-optimal, behavior
  - Quick to benchmark
  - Quick to seek out benchmarks

# Rethinking realism and generalization

&nbsp;
<blockquote>
Whereas [randomized evaluations] generally have high mundane
realism, some—but not all!—laboratory and survey experiments do not and thus provide a poor basis for external validity inferences
.right[-- Findley et al. (2021)]
</blockquote>


- Realism/parallelism of experiment...
  - cannot establish external validity
  - may limit, rather than strictly enhance, external validity
  
- Study should mimic the target of generalization

# Criteria for external validity

### in 'synthetic' experiments for testing theory

- Setup
  - Identify theory testing as central goal
  - Ground generalization in theory
  - Specify models & *a priori* propositions under study  

- Design
  - Exp "world" captures only essential essence of the models
  - Creates space for contested behaviors to emerge
  - Experimental realism

# *Quality Control* and beyond

- Integration-appraisal framework
  - I/A *necessary* for RV
  - Allowed to unfold in controlled settings
  
- Findings from 11 experimental tests
  - Capacity beyond blind retrospection
  - Strategic, imperfect benchmarking 

- Next steps  
  - Appraise first, integrate later
  - Locating negativity bias
